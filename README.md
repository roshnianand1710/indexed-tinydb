**Indexed TinyDB**

This is a **proof-of-concept** project which experiments with adding custom user-defined indexing in TinyDB.

The user decides which attribute to index and which level of the json document to index.
Hash indexing : Exact-match queries 
B+ Tree indexing : Range queries

Built for research purposes only.
