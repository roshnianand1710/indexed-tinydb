# Indexed TinyDB

> **⚠️ Experimental – research prototype only. Not ready for production use.**

Indexed TinyDB is a lightweight extension of [TinyDB](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb) that experiments with adding simple index support to accelerate lookups.

## Features

- **Exact‑match queries**  
- **Range queries**

## Current Limitations

- Supports **one table per JSON file** only – extending to multiple tables will require further work.
- Several core TinyDB features are still missing or incomplete.

## Project Status

This project is in an early proof‑of‑concept stage and exists solely for research purposes. Expect breaking changes and incomplete functionality.

Contributions and ideas are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests.
